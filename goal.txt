-Consistent menu / sidebar UI on every screen
-Where possible, treeviews that reflect what you're in (etc customer screen see all customers)
-Multiple tkinter widgets to refuce the amount the user has to type in and improve validation
-Use hover text
-Keybind events, i.e. making treeview interactive
-Help facility
-No back buttons, easy navigation
-Clear validation
-Make sure database entries have primary keys
-If we're searching for someone, don't make the search based on an ID (not good for UX)

-For login screen
	Enter new user
	Enter username / password to login
	Validation
	Some method to restore forgotten password
	Logo of company
	Nice UI
